                What is Rabies?

            <pre>
                The most common way that the viral illness rabies 
                is spread is by the biting of a rabid animal. 
                The rabies virus attacks mammals' central nervous systems,
                which leads to brain illness and eventual death. 
                The majority of rabies cases that are reported to 
                the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
                each year involve wild animals including bats, raccoons,
                skunks, and foxes, although any mammal can contract the disease.

                The rabies virus (RABV) belongs to the family Rhabdoviridae 
                and is the type specimen of the genus Lyssavirus. 
                The prototype virus of the genus Vesiculovirus of the same family, 
                vesicular stomatitis virus, shares similarities with RABV in terms of shape, 
                chemical composition, and life cycle. One of seven lyssavirus genotypes 
                includes RABV and the variants known as the rabies-related lyssaviruses,
                which share with the rabies virus the unique potential to cause a rabies-like 
                encephalomyelitis in addition to other RABV properties. Many of the biological 
                and physicochemical traits connected to other rhabdoviruses are also present
                in lyssaviruses. Many of the biological tasks that these viral proteins 
                perform in other rhabdoviruses are also performed by these lyssavirus proteins.
                Similar methods are used by lyssaviruses and other rhabdoviruses to enter 
                vulnerable cells, express and replicate their genome RNA, and release mature
                virus particles from infected cells' plasma membranes. The structure, 
                molecular makeup, and morphology of the rabies virus, the RNA genome's
                structure and organization, and the molecular biology of the rabies virus 
                proteins are the main topics of this chapter. The chapter also summarizes 
                current understanding of the viral life cycle in infected host cells 
                and viral transmission mechanisms.
