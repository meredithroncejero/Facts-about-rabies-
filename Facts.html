            <h1>What is Rabies?</h1>
            <p>The rabies virus, that comes to the Lyssavirus genus and is a member of the Rhabdoviridae family, 
                is the culprit behind rabies, a zoonotic disease that is spread from animals to people. 
                Over 99% of human fatalities from rabies are generated by dog-mediated rabies, 
                making domestic dogs the most frequent reservoir of the virus. </p>

                <pre>
                    Half of the people who die from rabies are under the age of 15.
                    Rabies is a big problem in Asia, Afica and Latin America.
                    In the United States, rabies has been repored in every state except Hawaii.
                    Rabies got its name from a Latin word that means "to range". 
                    That's because animals with rabies sometimes acts as if they are angry.
                    Rabies attacks the brain and spinal cord. If it is not prevented, it will cause death.

Any mammal can get rabies. It can only be passed to another animal or a person through saliva. You cannot get rabies from blood.

Animals with rabies may act differently. It´s always best to stay away from wild animals and to be careful with other people´s pets.

If there´s a chance the animal has rabies, your doctor will want to give you the rabies vaccine to make sure you don´t get rabies, too.

To prevent rabies:

vaccinate your dogs, cats and ferrets against rabies;
keep your pets under your supervision so they don´t catch rabies from a wild animal;
don´t handle wild animals and if you see one acting strangely, call your local animal control officer;
if you´re bitten by an animal, wash the wound with soap and water for at least five minutes, and then go see your doctor; and
have your pets spayed or neutered so they´ll be more likely to stay home.
