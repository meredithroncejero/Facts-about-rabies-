            <h1>What is Rabies?</h1>
           
            <ul>

            <p>The rabies virus, that comes to the Lyssavirus genus and is a member of the Rhabdoviridae family, 
                is the culprit behind rabies, a zoonotic disease that is spread from animals to people. 
                Over 99% of human fatalities from rabies are generated by dog-mediated rabies, 
                making domestic dogs the most frequent reservoir of the virus.</p>

                    Rabies is a serious disease that is caused by a virus.
                     This year, over 59,000 people will die from rabies. 
                     That's one person every 9 minutes.
                     Rabies is 100% preventable. Animals can be vaccinated and 
                     people who have been bitten can receive vaccines to fight the disease.</li>

            <li><img src="image/th.jfif" class="img-responsive" width="35" height="50">
                    Half of the people who die from rabies are under the age of 15.
                    Rabies is a big problem in Asia, Afica and Latin America.
                    In the United States, rabies has been repored in every state except Hawaii.
                    Rabies got its name from a Latin word that means "to range". 
                    That's because animals with rabies sometimes acts as if they are angry.
                    Rabies attacks the brain and spinal cord. If it is not prevented, it will cause death.</li>

<li><img src="image/th.jfif" class="img-responsive" width="35" height="50">Any mammal can get rabies. It can only be passed to another animal or a person through saliva. You cannot get rabies from blood.</li>

<li><img src="image/th.jfif" class="img-responsive" width="35" height="50">Animals with rabies may act differently. It´s always best to stay away from wild animals and to be careful with other people´s pets.</li>

<li><img src="image/th.jfif" class="img-responsive" width="35" height="50">Cartoon drawing of a syringeIf you are bitten, have someone help you wash out the wound for five minutes with soap and water and then take you right away to a doctor.
     If there´s a chance the animal has rabies, your doctor will want to give you the rabies vaccine to make sure you don´t get rabies, too.</li>
