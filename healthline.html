                        <h3>How do you know if an animal has RABIES?</h3>
                        <li>When rabid, some animals may exhibit crazy behavior. 
                            They'll be aggressive, and they might even try to bite you or other animals. 
                            Movies depict rabies-infected animals as having mouth foam. 
                            Actually, they are drooling because the rabies increases their saliva production.</li>
                        <li>
                            When they have rabies, other animals may display hesitant or shy behavior. 
                            The most typical kind is this one. A wild animal may behave tamely or move slowly. 
                            It might be simple for you to approach it. You should keep in mind that since that 
                            isn't how wild animals typically behave, something might be amiss.
                        </li>
                        <p>&emsp;</p>
                        <h4>
                            The only way doctors can know for sure if an animal or a person has rabies is to do a laboratory tests.
                        </h4>
                        <li>The best course of action is never to approach or feed a wild animal. Be cautious with animals you don't know. 
                            Don't pet a stray dog or cat if you see one. And if any animal is behaving oddly, 
                            contact your neighborhood animal control officer for assistance.</li>

                  <p>It could take a person with rabies one, two, or even three months to exhibit symptoms. But after contracting rabies, victims almost always pass away. Because of this, it's crucial to visit a doctor as soon as possible if you've been bitten by an animal that may have rabies.</p>

                    <li>You might not notice anything is amiss for a month, two months, or even longer. As it travels through the nervous system, the rabies virus binds to nerve cells. When the infection eventually reaches the brain, it's typically too late for medical intervention.</li>
                    <li>Inform a grownup immediately away! For at least five minutes, have them cleanse the wound with soap and water. So that the doctor can determine whether you require additional medical care, have them take you to a doctor as soon as they can.Have an adult call the animal control officer in your area. If the animal that bit you is a pet like a dog, cat, or ferret, the animal may be watched for signs of rabies for 10 days. The animal control officer will attempt to capture the wild animal, which may subsequently be killed so that it can be tested for rabies.</li>

                    <li>Anti-rabies vaccinations are available immediately away. Five of them will be distributed over a 14-day period. On the first day, you receive two shotsâ€”one in the arm and one close to the area where you were bitten. You receive the remaining shots in your arm.</li>
                    <li>The shots assist your body in producing "antibodies." A unique substance called an antibody will assault the virus and hinder its ability to penetrate a nerve cell. If your body generates enough antibodies, the virus will die.</li>

                    <li>The moist substance in your mouth, saliva, is how rabies is transmitted. No blood, urine, or excrement can spread it. You could contract rabies if an animal that has the disease bites you or licks its claw before scratching you.</li>
                    <li>It is impossible to contract rabies from petting an infected animal.</li>
                    <li>The good news is that there are injections you can obtain to prevent having rabies if you are bitten or scratched by an animal that has the disease.</li>

                    <li>Inform an adult immediately! They should spend at least five minutes washing the wound with soap and water. The doctor can then determine whether you require more medical care by having them take you there as quickly as possible.</li>
                    <li>Contact the animal control officer in your area through an adult. If the animal that bit you was a pet, such as a dog, cat, or ferret, the animal may be kept under observation for 10 days for rabies symptoms. If it's a wild animal, the animal control officer will attempt to catch it, and if unsuccessful, it may be killed to allow for rabies testing.</li>

                    <li>Compared to other wild animals, raccoons are more likely to carry rabies, yet bat bites are the main source of rabies in humans.</li>
                    <li>The issue is that because bat bites can be so little, you might not consider them to be severe and fail to report them to anyone. You should act as if you have been bitten and tell an adult as soon as you can if you find a bat in your home, especially in the bedroom where you are sleeping. If an adult can capture the bat, you can test it to see if it had rabies.</li>
