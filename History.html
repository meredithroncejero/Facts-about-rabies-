                <h1>History</h1>
                <p> People have been terrified after being bitten by rabid dogs for ages.
                    However, one must travel far back in time to know that until the 19th
                    century, neither humans nor animals could be accurately diagnosed 
                    with the disease, the infectious agent could not be isolated, there 
                    was no animal management, and there was no human treatment. 
                    Celsus understood that wild animals have a part in the spread of rabies. 
                    Wolves have frequently been mentioned in the histories of violent 
                    breakouts in wild animals and the ensuing human cases. The majority 
                    of developed nations have virtually completely eliminated canine rabies, 
                    however there have been more occurrences of wildlife rabies reported. 
                    The prevention of wildlife rabies is a different issue because there 
                    is no way to vaccinate the tens of thousands of animals required to do so. 
                    Through the use of a variety of attenuated and recombinant rabies vaccines, 
                    as well as in raccoons and coyotes, the oral vaccination method has eliminated 
                    rabies in many Western European countries and eastern Canada. 
                    In the underdeveloped world, rabid canines are virtually invariably 
                    the source of human rabies cases, although this is no longer the case in the industrialized world.</p>
