        <h2>Transmission</h2>
            <p> Rabies is most commonTrusted Source in countries where stray dogs are present in large numbers, with Asia and Africa accounting for 95% of casesTrusted Source.
                As saliva carries the virusTrusted Source, rabies can develop if an infected animal bites someone. It can also occur if saliva from an infected animal gets into an open wound or through a mucous membrane, such as the eyes or mouth. However, the virus cannot pass through unbroken skin.
                In the U.S., raccoons, coyotes, bats, skunks, and foxes are the animals most likelyTrusted Source to spread the virus. Bats carrying rabies exist in all U.S. states except Hawaii.
                Any mammal can harbor and transmit the virus, but smaller mammals, such as rodents, rarely become infectedTrusted Source or transmit rabies. Rabbits are also unlikely to spread rabies.

        <h2>Causes and Symptoms</h2>
            <p><b>What are the symptoms of rabies in humans?</b></p>
            <p> You usually have no symptoms of rabies for several weeks after it enters your body. When rabies makes it to your central nervous system (prodromal phase), you experience flu-like symptoms. In the final stages, you have neurological (brain) symptoms.
                </p>
        <h2>Diagnosis and Test</h2>
            <p><b>How is rabies diagnosed?</b></p>
            <p> Unlike most illnesses, you shouldn’t wait for symptoms to diagnose rabies. If you’ve been bitten or scratched by a wild animal or a pet that might have rabies, talk to your healthcare provider right away. They’ll examine your wound and ask questions to determine whether you need to be treated for rabies. You may also be tested for signs of rabies.
                </p>
            <p><b>Why does rabies cause a fear of water?</b></p>
            <p> People used to call rabies hydrophobia because it appears to cause a fear of water. The reason is that the infection causes intense spasms in the throat when a person tries to swallow. Even the thought of swallowing water can cause spasms, making it appear that the individual is afraid of water.
                </p>
        <h2>Management and Treatment</h2>
            <p><b>How is rabies treated?</b></p>
            <p> There’s no approved treatment for rabies once you have symptoms. If you’ve been exposed to rabies (were bitten by or been in contact with an infected animal), contact a healthcare provider as soon as possible.
                Clean the wound gently but thoroughly with soap and water. Ask your provider for additional instructions on cleaning the wound.
                Your provider will give you a series of shots (vaccinations) to prevent the virus from causing rabies. They’ll also give you an antibody treatment directly to the wound if you’ve never been vaccinated before.                
                </p>
            <p><b>What medications are used if one does come into contact with a suspected rabid animal?</b></p>
            <p><b>Why is there no cure for rabies?</b></p>
            <p> There’s no cure for rabies once it’s moved to your brain because it’s protected by your blood-brain barrier.
                Your blood-brain barrier is a layer between your brain and the blood vessels in your head. Its job is to protect your brain by keeping toxins and other dangerous substances from getting into your brain from your blood. It’s like a very fine strainer.
                Researchers aren’t sure how, but rabies locks this barrier down even further, so medications that might destroy it can’t get through.
